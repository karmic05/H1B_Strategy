Strategic Employer Targeting for F-1 OPT Students in the 2025 H-1B Landscape

📌 Overview

This project provides a data-driven analysis of H-1B employer trends (2020–2024) to help F-1 OPT students identify high-probability sponsorship pathways under the evolving 2025 H-1B environment. The analysis incorporates political context, LCA (Labor Condition Application) trends, wage patterns, industry-specific hiring behavior, and geographic hotspots for long-term work visa sponsorship.

⸻

🎯 Objectives
	•	Identify top H-1B sponsoring employers using LCA + USCIS datasets.
	•	Highlight high-growth industries and states with consistent sponsorship patterns.
	•	Evaluate salary benchmarks, SOC roles, and NAICS industry trends.
	•	Provide actionable recommendations for OPT students navigating the 2025 H-1B cycle.
	•	Use SQL queries to extract insights from the H-1B database (employers, wages, states, industries).

⸻

🔍 Key Insights
	•	Major sponsors include Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Deloitte, Cognizant, and Accenture, with strong LCA volumes across tech + consulting sectors.
	•	Geographic hotspots: California, Texas, Washington (Tech); Massachusetts + North Carolina (Biotech/Clean Energy).
	•	High-paying roles: Software Engineering, Data Science, AI/ML, Cybersecurity with median LCA wages >$140,000.
	•	Emerging industries like AI safety, generative AI, and green tech show high salaries but inconsistent filing histories.
	•	54.8% of H-1B recipients previously held F-1 visas—showing strong transition potential under OPT → H-1B pathways.

⸻

🛠 Tech Stack
	•	SQL (MySQL Workbench)
	•	Data extraction & transformation from LCA + USCIS datasets
	•	Analytical tables & CTE queries for wages, employers, job types, and geographical patterns
	•	Documentation + policy impact analysis

⸻

📂 What’s Inside
	•	SQL scripts to identify:
	•	Top employers by state & NAICS industry
	•	Highest-paying SOC roles
	•	Outliers in prevailing wage vs offered wage
	•	Most common worksites
	•	Research-backed recommendations for OPT job targeting
	•	Policy context for 2025 H-1B updates
	•	Data-driven sponsorship strategy for international students

⸻

🧭 Recommendations (Summary)
	•	Prioritize employers filing 100+ LCAs annually in your field.
	•	Target high-sponsorship states & industries with strong historical filings.
	•	Leverage STEM OPT extension as a low-cost retention pathway for employers.
	•	Monitor political shifts—Democratic administrations historically increase STEM-friendly visa access.
	•	Track high-growth fields (AI, Data, Clean Energy) where sponsorship demand is increasing.
